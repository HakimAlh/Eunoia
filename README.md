favouriteList. And a searchbar for the book you want.

## Why is it named Eunoia?
Eunoia means beautiful thinking, goodwill to all and a bridging of the heart and the mind.
It says a lot! The beautiful thought of making a book that comes from the heart and mind!

## Why did you choose this kind of app for the project?
I think because from what I see there's apps or websites like that that I've seen that are mostly
restrictive to the "Novels" genre. So why not I make all in one Book Library?
